        <h3>ðŸŽ¶ Music & Sound</h3>
        <p>Let music hold what words cannot. Through curated soundscapes, voice, and silence, you reconnect with rhythm and emotion in safe, gentle ways.</p>

      <div class="modality">
        <h3>ðŸŽ¨ Art & Expression</h3>
        <p>Not everything needs to be spoken. Art offers a powerful way to explore feelings visually â€” through color, shape, texture, and metaphor.</p>

      <div class="modality">
        <h3>ðŸ’¬ Talking Circles</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, clarity arises from shared words. We offer reflective one-on-one and group sessions where youâ€™re heard with presence, not pressure.</p>

      <div class="modality">
        <h3>ðŸ§˜ Mindful Practices</h3>
        <p>Breath, pause, presence. Our guided stillness sessions support you in feeling grounded and relaxed through meditation, breathwork, or gentle movement.</p>
