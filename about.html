      <h2>Our Journey</h2>
      <p>
        AlterFeels was born from a simple belief: that everyone deserves a space where they feel heard, understood, and supported. Life — with all its highs and lows — can often feel overwhelming, and we believe no one should have to navigate it alone.

    <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you're feeling stuck in your personal world, seeking balance in your professional space, or just looking to reconnect with yourself — AlterFeels is a space to reflect, recalibrate, and realign.
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer structured support sessions across various formats — be it expressive outlets like music and art, grounding practices like meditation, or simple, meaningful conversations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our approach is fluid and personal — we’re not here to "fix" but to walk with you.

  <h2>Hi, I'm Sudhan - Let's Chat</h2>
    <img src="images/sudimg.jpeg" alt="Mind behind AlterFeels" class="founder-photo">
  <p>
    With over two decades of experience in global organisations — building products, shaping teams, mentoring minds — I’ve always been drawn to what makes us feel connected, creative, and truly heard.
    <br><br>
    My journey weaves together a love for music, art, and psychology with a deep commitment to people — understanding not just what is said, but also what remains unspoken. Whether guiding teams or holding space for individuals, I've found purpose in nurturing clarity, emotional insight, and authentic communication.
    <br><br>
    AlterFeels is an expression of that calling — a place where professional experience meets human curiosity, where structured support blends with soulful exploration, and where each person is met with intention, not instruction.

<div class="signature founder-note">
  <p>
    AlterFeels isn’t just a platform — it’s a reflection of everything I’ve learned, unlearned, and continue to explore about being human.  
    <br><br>
    If you’re here, I’m glad our paths crossed. I hope this space gives you room to breathe, reflect, and reconnect.
