      <h2>Our Journey</h2>
      <p>
        AlterFeels was born from a simple belief: that everyone deserves a space where they feel heard, understood, and supported. Life — with all its highs and lows — can often feel overwhelming, and we believe no one should have to navigate it alone.

  <h2>Who’s Behind AlterFeels?</h2>
  <p>
    This space was started by someone who knows what it feels like to carry too much, to search for meaning in quiet chaos, and to long for honest connection. 
    <br><br>
    With a background in reflective practices, creative exploration, and structured support frameworks, I created AlterFeels to offer what I once sought — a soft space to land.
