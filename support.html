    <h2>The Power of Support</h2>
    <p>Behind every thriving heart, there’s a network of quiet support. At AlterFeels, we believe that no one should walk their emotional journey alone.</p>

    <h2>Why Does Support Matter?</h2>
    <p>Life can be overwhelming. Even the strongest among us have days when uncertainty clouds clarity, or when emotions feel too heavy to carry alone. A reliable support structure offers more than advice — it offers presence, understanding, and strength.</p>

    <h2>How Support Transforms</h2>
    <div class="support-points">
      <div class="support-point">
        <h4>Being Heard</h4>
        <p>Sometimes the most powerful healing happens when someone simply listens, without trying to fix anything.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="support-point">
        <h4>Rediscovering Strength</h4>
        <p>Support nurtures the resilience within, reminding you of your capacity to adapt, heal, and grow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="support-point">
        <h4>Building Safe Spaces</h4>
        <p>It creates an emotional environment where vulnerability is welcomed, not judged.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="support-point">
        <h4>Encouraging Authenticity</h4>
        <p>Support encourages you to live and express your truth, free from expectations or fear.</p>

  <h2>How Sessions Work</h2>

  <div class="hsw-container">
    <div class="hsw-block">
      <h3>A gentle beginning</h3>
      <p>Every journey starts with a short 20-minute conversation — a calm space where you share what feels right and we understand what you're navigating. No pressure, just a grounded start.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hsw-block">
      <h3>Space to choose what feels right</h3>
      <p>You’re offered approaches that match your comfort — reflective conversations, expressive activities, grounding practices or simple clarity-building. You decide what resonates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hsw-block">
      <h3>A personalised path, built together</h3>
      <p>We sketch a flexible direction — not a strict plan, but a supportive guide that evolves with you. Every step prioritises emotional safety and clarity.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hsw-block">
      <h3>Sessions shaped around your needs</h3>
      <p>Each session shifts with your emotional rhythm — talk, reflect, create, or explore with structure. The space adapts to what the day needs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hsw-block">
      <h3>Support between sessions (optional)</h3>
      <p>If you want it, you receive gentle check-ins or grounding prompts. If you prefer space, the process respects that too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="hsw-block">
      <h3>Periodic reflection & realignment</h3>
      <p>We pause occasionally to review what feels lighter, what changed, and what direction feels right now. The journey stays meaningful and adaptive.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section class="story">
    <h2>A Gentle Reminder</h2>
    <p>You are not a burden. Your emotions are valid. Reaching out isn’t weakness — it’s courage. At AlterFeels, we honor every story, every silence, every hope you bring.</p>
